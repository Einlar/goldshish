We're well on our way to sending data from the server to the client, but there's just one problem: we don't *have* any data. Let's fix this by inserting a few documents into our \`Movies\` collection. 

We actually already have a \`seedMovies\` function ready, we just need to call it. We can do so using the [Meteor shell](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteorshell), a convenient way to access your live Meteor development server.

Open a new Terminal window in your Vulcan application directory, type:
`,`
~~~sh
meteor shell
~~~
`,`
And then:
`,`
~~~js
import { seedMovies } from 'meteor/getting-started'
~~~
`,`
And finally:
`,`
~~~js
seedMovies()
~~~
`];

const after = [`
Well done! A GraphQL request to the \`moviesCount\` query has confirmed that there are now movies seeded into our database. 

By the way, a useful companion to the Meteor Shell is Meteor's [database access](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteormongo):
`,`
~~~sh
meteor mongo
~~~
`,`
For example, here's how you would display all movies in your database:
`,`
~~~js
db.movies.find()
~~~
`,`
And here's how you would remove them all:
`,`
~~~js
db.movies.remove({})
~~~
