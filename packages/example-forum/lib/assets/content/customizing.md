If you want to learn how to customize Vulcan, we suggest checking out the [docs](http://docs.vulcanjs.org).

The first things you'll want to do are probably create a `settings.json` file to hold all your settings, and then taking a look at the sample custom package by uncommenting `example-customization` in `.meteor/packages`.

Here are two tutorials to get further:
* [Getting Started](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/#Getting-Started)
* [Customization Example](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/example-customization.html)

Happy hacking!
